$h3 Features

Using the $project.name you can...

* Configure your software product's licensing schema using an internal
  Domain Specific Language (DSL) with a fluent design.
* Manually or automatically start a free trial period (FTP) for users.
* Sell different types of license keys for different editions.
* Install license keys to files, preferences nodes or any custom store.
* Create license keys by duplicating, initializing, validating,
  encoding, signing, encoding (again), compressing and encrypting
  license beans.
* Encode arbitrary properties into license keys using XML.
* Take advantage of a predefined set of common properties for the licensing
  subject, license issuer/vendor, license holder/consumer, license term,
  consumer type/amount and more.
* Vend and consume version-1 (V1) or version-2-with-XML (V2/XML) license keys:
    * Use the V1 license key format in order to enable full compatibility with
      existing license keys for software products upgrading from
      TrueLicense 1.
    * Use the V2/XML license key format in order to take advantage of enhanced
      compression and encryption for new software products.
* Exploit the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) for authentication
  and encryption with configurable algorithms and parameters.
* Select custom strategies for hardware dongling:
    * Implement a custom license validationÂ for testing the MAC addresses of
      the computer, or...
    * use a custom JCA provider for accessing a key store on a SmartCard, or...
    * use removable storage media for persisting key stores.
* Take advantage of an internationalized API with English and German
  localizations.
* Configure an authoritative clock to prevent against attacks on the
  validity period of installed license keys.
* Configure caching of intermediate results of the processing chain for super
  fast license verification and viewing.
