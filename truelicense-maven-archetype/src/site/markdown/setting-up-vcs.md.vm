#title("Setting Up a VCS")

This page shows you how to set-up a Version Control System for your project so 
that you can track any changes to the source code.
The VCS will also cover the key store files which are automatically generated 
when [building your project] for the first time.

$h3 Using Mercurial

For [Mercurial], the project directory already contains a `.hgignore` file, so
all you need to do is:

    ${dollar} hg init
    ${dollar} hg add
    [...]
    ${dollar} hg commit -m "Initial commit."

Whenever you have changed any source files, you can commit your changes as
follows:

    ${dollar} hg add
    [...]
    ${dollar} hg commit

$h3 Using Git

For [Git], the project directory already contains a `.gitignore` file, so
all you need to do is:

    ${dollar} git init
    [...]
    ${dollar} git add .
    ${dollar} git commit -m "Initial commit."
    [...]

Whenever you have changed any source files, you can commit your changes as
follows:

    ${dollar} git add .
    ${dollar} git commit
    [...]
