This page shows you how to use the internationalized Graphical User Interface 
of your project, or more specifically, its Key Manager module.
**However, if the value of the property `disableLicenseWizard` has been set to 
`true` when [generating your project], then the GUI is not available and this 
page does not apply to your project!**

$h3 Starting the GUI

The Swing wizard dialog integrates the `install`, `verify`, `view` and
`uninstall` actions of the 
<abbr title="Command Line Interface">[CLI](using-cli.html)</abbr> in a 
convenient GUI.
You can start the dialog using the CLI using:

    ${dollar} java -jar *-keymgr/target/*-keymgr-*-guarded.jar wizard

$h3 Welcome Panel

When running the dialog for the first time, it may seem that there is already a
valid license key installed.
This is because an <abbr title="Free Trial Period">FTP</abbr> license key is 
automatically generated and installed if the property `freeTrialPeriod` is not 
set to zero when generating your project:

<img src="img/welcome-panel.png" alt="Welcome Panel" width="636" height="554"/>

If the property `hideUninstallAction` has been set to `true` when generating 
your project, then the "Uninstall ..." action is not shown.

$h3 Install Panel

For license key installation, you can navigate to the license key file that
you may have created when [using the CLI]:

<img src="img/install-panel.png" alt="Install Panel" width="636" height="554"/>

$h3 Display Panel Showing Regular License Key

Once the license key file has been successfully installed, the display panel
might look like this:

<img src="img/display-panel-standard.png" alt="Display Panel Showing Regular License Key" width="636" height="554"/>

$h3 Display Panel Showing FTP License Key

If a free trial period is configured and no regular license key has been 
installed, then the FTP license key is displayed:

<img src="img/display-panel-ftp.png" alt="Display Panel Showing FTP License Key" width="636" height="554"/>

$h3 Uninstall Panel

Uninstalling the license key (if not hidden) should look like this: 

<img src="img/uninstall-panel.png" alt="Uninstall Panel" width="636" height="554"/>

You can only uninstall a regular license key, but not an auto-generated FTP 
license key.
Any attempt to uninstall an auto-generated FTP license key results in an error
message.
