#title("Generating Your Project")

This page shows you how to generate your project from the $project.name.
Generating a project from the archetype involves customizing a set of property
values as explained below.

$h3 Important Notes

1. **If you want to change the value of any of the following properties then
   it's generally necessary to generate another project from the TrueLicense 
   Maven Archetype.**
2. **For any two generated projects, their license keys are not compatible even
   if all property values are equal, unless both projects also share a copy of
   the same key store files:**
    * `${artifactId}-keygen/src/main/resources/${dollar}{privateKeyStoreFile}`,
    * `${artifactId}-keymgr/src/main/resources/${dollar}{ftpKeyStoreFile}` and
    * `${artifactId}-keymgr/src/main/resources/${dollar}{publicKeyStoreFile}`.

$h3 Generation Action

Please copy the following sample command, customize the property values to
match your licensing schema and paste the result into a shell:

    ${dollar} mvn archetype:generate -B \
        -DarchetypeArtifactId=$project.artifactId \
        -DarchetypeGroupId=$project.groupId \
        -DarchetypeVersion=$project.version \
        -DartifactId=license \
        -DcompanyName="Company Inc." \
        -DgroupId=com.company.product \
        -DlicensingSubject="Product 1" \
        -Dpassword=test1234 \
        -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
    [...]

Throughout this tutorial, a leading `${dollar} ` indicates a shell prompt and
a `[...]` indicates command output, so please don't copy/paste these.
The properties `archetypeArtifactId`, `archetypeGroupId` and `archetypeVersion`
reference the $project.name itself, so you shouldn't change their values.
All other property values are customizable as explained in the following
reference.

Furthermore, you may sometimes see an expression starting with a `${dollar}`,
followed by a name in braces.
Such an expression is a reference to the value of the equal named property.
For example, assuming that the project is generated as shown above, the
expression `${dollar}{package}` is a reference to the value
`com.company.product`.
This syntax has been borrowed from [Apache Maven].

Upon successful execution, a new directory with the artifact ID as its name
exists in the current directory.
For the rest of this documentation, all commands assume that this is the
current directory, so you need to change to it now:

    ${dollar} cd ${dollar}{artifactId}

$h3 Property Reference

Following is the list of properties for generating a project from the
$project.name in alphabetic order.
Note that property values are generally _case sensitive_.
