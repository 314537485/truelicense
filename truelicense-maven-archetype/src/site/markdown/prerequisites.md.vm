This page shows you what you need to work with TrueLicense.

$h3 Software

For using TrueLicense, you just need to have a Java Runtime Environment,
version $maven-enforcer-requireJavaVersion or later installed.

For generating and building a project from the $project.name, you also need to
use [Apache Maven], version $maven-enforcer-requireMavenVersion or later.
You are not required to use Maven for using the project in your software
product however:
Once you are done [building your project], you can just add the
standalone JARs or the regular JARs plus their dependency JARs to the class path
of your software product - see [using the API].

It's also strongly recommended, but not strictly necessary, to use a source
code management system, e.g. [Git] or [Mercurial] - see [setting up a VCS].

$h3 TrueLicense Certificate

TrueLicense is [dual licensed](../licensing.html):
For **closed source software**, you need to subscribe to the commercial
licensing program for TrueLicense and buy one or more TrueLicense 
certificates or **otherwise you are required to open source your software 
product** under the terms of the
[GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3](license.html#GNU_AFFERO_GENERAL_PUBLIC_LICENSE_Version_3_19_November_2007).
